### Day- 01
#### *8:30 am to 10 am* **S̲h̲a̲b̲a̲d̲ ̲K̲i̲r̲t̲a̲n̲**
What a delightful and **soul**ful experience it was! As we all, students of Btech First Year from CS and IT Branches gathered in the religious place to seek blessings from the Almighty for a new phase of life. An immenseful period of time which passed as quickly as a silent gust even though it lasted half an hour longer than it was supposed to.

#### *10 am to 10:15 am* **T̲e̲a̲ ̲A̲n̲d̲ ̲S̲n̲a̲c̲k̲s̲**
After Shabad Kirtan, all were headed right across the Gurdwara for some tea and snacks. It was supposed to last for 30 minutes but we were then asked to wrap it up under 15 minutes.

#### *10:15 am to 1"15 pm* **A̲u̲d̲i̲t̲o̲r̲i̲u̲m̲**
All the freshmen started moving toards the Auditorium where we were told to attend some speeches of supposed dignitaries. There used to be many guest lectures in my school and the auditorium speeched made by various guests appeared ike one except for the fact that all of them were delayed by half an hour or so. I am sure it must've been frustrating for some to wait for such long ideally and so was I at first, but I guess it wasn't such a big deal for college autorities after all as the students witnessed more delays in subsequent classes and lectures the following days.

#### *1:15 pm to 1:30 pm* **B̲r̲e̲a̲k̲**
I really had to gobble up my food as we were told to report back after finally getting over the tedious lectures which kept on repeating themselves, within mere 15 minutes. Though the break was supposed be of 1 and a half hour, the poor time management by the staff once again kept getting on my nerves.

#### *1:30 pm to 4 pm* **I̲n̲t̲r̲o̲d̲u̲c̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ ̲T̲o̲ ̲C̲l̲a̲s̲s̲e̲s̲**
We were finally introduced to our class, some of the activity incharges who introduced and familiarised us to some concepts and norms of the college. The classrooms,quite modest in appearance sat about 40 students then with just windows and fans maintaining the cool atmosphere which was also aided by the rainy wind. We sat there for quite a while... Again longer than we were supposed to and finally, were discharged which marked the end of the first day of college.
